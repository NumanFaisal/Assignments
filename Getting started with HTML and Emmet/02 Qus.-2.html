    <p style="text-align: justify;">You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax: <!-- Write your comments here --> Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag. Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.</p>

    <h3>How to write a comment in HTML</h3>

    <!-- Paragraph -->
     <p>To leave a comment in HTML, place a <b> <"!-- tag before the code and a --"></b> tag after the code that you want to hide. These tags tell browsers to ignore anything between them. For example, say youâ€™re building a website with a team of developers. You want to leave a note reminding them that all buttons should use the same color. You can also quickly comment a line of code with the keyboard shortcut <b>Ctrl + / on PC or Command + /</b>. This method is much faster than typing the tags manually</p>
