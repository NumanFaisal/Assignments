    <h1>Meta tags</h1>
    <p>Meta tags, on the other hand, are special HTML tags that provide information about a web page to search engines and other web services. They are placed in the head section of an HTML document and are not displayed to the user. Some common meta tags include the < title > tag, which specifies the title of the page, and the < meta name="description" > tag, which provides a brief description of the page for search engines. Other meta tags can specify the author of the page, the keywords associated with the page, and the character encoding used on the page. Meta tags are important for search engine optimization (SEO) and can help improve the visibility and ranking of a website in search results.</p>
