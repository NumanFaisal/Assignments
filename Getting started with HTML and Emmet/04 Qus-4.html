An entire blog post, news article, or similar content can be displayed with the <"article"> element.</li>
        <li><b><"body"></b> <"body"> tags in HTML are responsible for defining the main content within a page. This can include text, paragraphs, headings, images, tables, links, and videos.</li>
        <li><b><"p"></b> Paragraph is defined by the <"p"> tag.Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</li>
